Title: ePointDA: An End-to-End Simulation-to-Real Domain Adaptation Framework
  for LiDAR Point Cloud Segmentation
Authors: Sicheng Zhao, Yezhen Wang, Bo Li, Bichen Wu, Yang Gao, Pengfei Xu,
  Trevor Darrell, Kurt Keutzer
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Due to its robust and precise distance measurements, LiDAR plays an important
role in scene understanding for autonomous driving. Training deep neural
networks (DNNs) on LiDAR data requires large-scale point-wise annotations,
which are time-consuming and expensive to obtain. Instead, simulation-to-real
domain adaptation (SRDA) trains a DNN using unlimited synthetic data with
automatically generated labels and transfers the learned model to real
scenarios. Existing SRDA methods for LiDAR point cloud segmentation mainly
employ a multi-stage pipeline and focus on feature-level alignment. They
require prior knowledge of real-world statistics and ignore the pixel-level
dropout noise gap and the spatial feature gap between different domains. In
this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end framework, named ePointDA, to address
the above issues. Specifically, ePointDA consists of three components:
self-supervised dropout noise rendering, statistics-invariant and
spatially-adaptive feature alignment, and transferable segmentation learning.
The joint optimization enables ePointDA to bridge the domain shift at the
pixel-level by explicitly rendering dropout noise for synthetic LiDAR and at
the feature-level by spatially aligning the features between different domains,
without requiring the real-world statistics. Extensive experiments adapting
from synthetic GTA-LiDAR to real KITTI and SemanticKITTI demonstrate the
superiority of ePointDA for LiDAR point cloud segmentation.

Title: LaSOT: A High-quality Large-scale Single Object Tracking Benchmark
Authors: Heng Fan, Hexin Bai, Liting Lin, Fan Yang, Peng Chu, Ge Deng, Sijia

\\
  Despite great recent advances in visual tracking, its further development,
including both algorithm design and evaluation, is limited due to lack of
dedicated large-scale benchmarks. To address this problem, we present LaSOT, a
high-quality Large-scale Single Object Tracking benchmark. LaSOT contains a
diverse selection of 85 object classes, and offers 1,550 totaling more than
3.87 million frames. Each video frame is carefully and manually annotated with
a bounding box. This makes LaSOT, to our knowledge, the largest densely
annotated tracking benchmark. Our goal in releasing LaSOT is to provide a
dedicated high quality platform for both training and evaluation of trackers.
The average video length of LaSOT is around 2,500 frames, where each video
contains various challenge factors that exist in real world video footage,such
as the targets disappearing and re-appearing. These longer video lengths allow
for the assessment of long-term trackers. To take advantage of the close
connection between visual appearance and natural language, we provide language
specification for each video in LaSOT. We believe such additions will allow for
future research to use linguistic features to improve tracking. Two protocols,
full-overlap and one-shot, are designated for flexible assessment of trackers.
We extensively evaluate 48 baseline trackers on LaSOT with in-depth analysis,
and results reveal that there still exists significant room for improvement.
The complete benchmark, tracking results as well as analysis are available at
https://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/~cvl/projects/lasot/.

Title: A Residual Solver and Its Unfolding Neural Network for Total Variation
  Regularized Models
Authors: Yuanhao Gong
Categories: cs.CV eess.IV math.OC
\\
  This paper proposes to solve the Total Variation regularized models by
finding the residual between the input and the unknown optimal solution. After
analyzing a previous method, we developed a new iterative algorithm, named as
Residual Solver, which implicitly solves the model in gradient domain. We
theoretically prove the uniqueness of the gradient field in our algorithm. We
further numerically confirm that the residual solver can reach the same global
optimal solutions as the classical method on 500 natural images. Moreover, we
unfold our iterative algorithm into a convolution neural network (named as
Residual Solver Network). This network is unsupervised and can be considered as
an "enhanced version" of our iterative algorithm. Finally, both the proposed
algorithm and neural network are successfully applied on several problems to
demonstrate their effectiveness and efficiency, including image smoothing,
denoising, and biomedical image reconstruction. The proposed network is general
and can be applied to solve other total variation regularized models.

Title: Few-Shot Hyperspectral Image Classification With Unknown Classes Using
  Multitask Deep Learning
Authors: Shengjie Liu, Qian Shi, and Liangpei Zhang
Categories: cs.CV
Comments: Accepted by IEEE TGRS
\\
  Current hyperspectral image classification assumes that a predefined
classification system is closed and complete, and there are no unknown or novel
classes in the unseen data. However, this assumption may be too strict for the
real world. Often, novel classes are overlooked when the classification system
is constructed. The closed nature forces a model to assign a label given a new
sample and may lead to overestimation of known land covers (e.g., crop area).
To tackle this issue, we propose a multitask deep learning method that
simultaneously conducts classification and reconstruction in the open world
(named MDL4OW) where unknown classes may exist. The reconstructed data are
compared with the original data; those failing to be reconstructed are
considered unknown, based on the assumption that they are not well represented
in the latent features due to the lack of labels. A threshold needs to be
defined to separate the unknown and known classes; we propose two strategies
based on the extreme value theory for few-shot and many-shot scenarios. The
proposed method was tested on real-world hyperspectral images; state-of-the-art
results were achieved, e.g., improving the overall accuracy by 4.94% for the
Salinas data. By considering the existence of unknown classes in the open
world, our method achieved more accurate hyperspectral image classification,
especially under the few-shot context.

Title: Region Comparison Network for Interpretable Few-shot Image
  Classification
Authors: Zhiyu Xue, Lixin Duan, Wen Li, Lin Chen and Jiebo Luo
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  While deep learning has been successfully applied to many real-world computer
vision tasks, training robust classifiers usually requires a large amount of
well-labeled data. However, the annotation is often expensive and
time-consuming. Few-shot image classification has thus been proposed to
effectively use only a limited number of labeled examples to train models for
new classes. Recent works based on transferable metric learning methods have
achieved promising classification performance through learning the similarity
between the features of samples from the query and support sets. However, rare
of them explicitly considers the model interpretability, which can actually be
revealed during the training phase.
  For that, in this work, we propose a metric learning based method named
Region Comparison Network (RCN), which is able to reveal how few-shot learning
works as in a neural network as well as to find out specific regions that are
related to each other in images coming from the query and support sets.
Moreover, we also present a visualization strategy named Region Activation
Mapping (RAM) to intuitively explain what our method has learned by visualizing
intermediate variables in our network. We also present a new way to generalize
the interpretability from the level of tasks to categories, which can also be
viewed as a method to find the prototypical parts for supporting the final
decision of our RCN. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets clearly
show the effectiveness of our method over existing baselines.

Title: A Self-Supervised Gait Encoding Approach with Locality-Awareness for 3D
  Skeleton Based Person Re-Identification

\\
  Person re-identification (Re-ID) via gait features within 3D skeleton
sequences is a newly-emerging topic with several advantages. Existing solutions
either rely on hand-crafted descriptors or supervised gait representation
learning. This paper proposes a self-supervised gait encoding approach that can
leverage unlabeled skeleton data to learn gait representations for person
Re-ID. Specifically, we first create self-supervision by learning to
reconstruct unlabeled skeleton sequences reversely, which involves richer
high-level semantics to obtain better gait representations. Other pretext tasks
are also explored to further improve self-supervised learning. Second, inspired
by the fact that motion's continuity endows adjacent skeletons in one skeleton
sequence and temporally consecutive skeleton sequences with higher correlations
(referred as locality in 3D skeleton data), we propose a locality-aware
attention mechanism and a locality-aware contrastive learning scheme, which aim
to preserve locality-awareness on intra-sequence level and inter-sequence level
respectively during self-supervised learning. Last, with context vectors
learned by our locality-aware attention mechanism and contrastive learning
scheme, a novel feature named Constrastive Attention-based Gait Encodings
(CAGEs) is designed to represent gait effectively. Empirical evaluations show
that our approach significantly outperforms skeleton-based counterparts by
15-40% Rank-1 accuracy, and it even achieves superior performance to numerous
multi-modal methods with extra RGB or depth information. Our codes are
available at https://github.com/Kali-Hac/Locality-Awareness-SGE.

Title: Rain rendering for evaluating and improving robustness to bad weather

  Rain fills the atmosphere with water particles, which breaks the common
assumption that light travels unaltered from the scene to the camera. While it
is well-known that rain affects computer vision algorithms, quantifying its
impact is difficult. In this context, we present a rain rendering pipeline that
enables the systematic evaluation of common computer vision algorithms to
controlled amounts of rain. We present three different ways to add synthetic
rain to existing images datasets: completely physic-based; completely
data-driven; and a combination of both. The physic-based rain augmentation
combines a physical particle simulator and accurate rain photometric modeling.
We validate our rendering methods with a user study, demonstrating our rain is
judged as much as 73% more realistic than the state-of-theart. Using our
generated rain-augmented KITTI, Cityscapes, and nuScenes datasets, we conduct a
thorough evaluation of object detection, semantic segmentation, and depth
estimation algorithms and show that their performance decreases in degraded
weather, on the order of 15% for object detection, 60% for semantic
segmentation, and 6-fold increase in depth estimation error. Finetuning on our
augmented synthetic data results in improvements of 21% on object detection,
37% on semantic segmentation, and 8% on depth estimation.

Title: Convolutional Neural Networks for Automatic Detection of Artifacts from
  Independent Components Represented in Scalp Topographies of EEG Signals
Authors: Giuseppe Placidi, Luigi Cinque, Matteo Polsinelli
Categories: cs.CV cs.AI
\\
  Electroencephalography (EEG) measures the electrical brain activity in
real-time by using sensors placed on the scalp. Artifacts, due to eye movements
and blink, muscular/cardiac activity and generic electrical disturbances, have
to be recognized and eliminated to allow a correct interpretation of the useful
brain signals (UBS) of EEG. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is effective
to split the signal into independent components (ICs) whose re-projections on
2D scalp topographies (images), also called topoplots, allow to
recognize/separate artifacts and by UBS. Until now, IC topoplot analysis, a
gold standard in EEG, has been carried on visually by human experts and, hence,
not usable in automatic, fast-response EEG. We present a completely automatic
and effective framework for EEG artifact recognition by IC topoplots, based on
2D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), capable to divide topoplots in 4
classes: 3 types of artifacts and UBS. The framework setup is described and
results are presented, discussed and compared with those obtained by other
competitive strategies. Experiments, carried on public EEG datasets, have shown
an overall accuracy of above 98%, employing 1.4 sec on a standard PC to
classify 32 topoplots, that is to drive an EEG system of 32 sensors. Though not
real-time, the proposed framework is efficient enough to be used in
fast-response EEG-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) and faster than other
automatic methods based on ICs.

Title: Adversarial Machine Learning in Image Classification: A Survey Towards
  the Defender's Perspective
Authors: Gabriel Resende Machado, Eug\^enio Silva and Ronaldo Ribeiro
  Goldschmidt
Categories: cs.CV
\\
  Deep Learning algorithms have achieved the state-of-the-art performance for
Image Classification and have been used even in security-critical applications,
such as biometric recognition systems and self-driving cars. However, recent
works have shown those algorithms, which can even surpass the human
capabilities, are vulnerable to adversarial examples. In Computer Vision,
adversarial examples are images containing subtle perturbations generated by
malicious optimization algorithms in order to fool classifiers. As an attempt
to mitigate these vulnerabilities, numerous countermeasures have been
constantly proposed in literature. Nevertheless, devising an efficient defense
mechanism has proven to be a difficult task, since many approaches have already
shown to be ineffective to adaptive attackers. Thus, this self-containing paper
aims to provide all readerships with a review of the latest research progress
on Adversarial Machine Learning in Image Classification, however with a
defender's perspective. Here, novel taxonomies for categorizing adversarial
attacks and defenses are introduced and discussions about the existence of
adversarial examples are provided. Further, in contrast to exisiting surveys,
it is also given relevant guidance that should be taken into consideration by
researchers when devising and evaluating defenses. Finally, based on the
reviewed literature, it is discussed some promising paths for future research.

Title: Analysis and Prediction of Deforming 3D Shapes using Oriented Bounding
  Boxes and LSTM Autoencoders
Authors: Sara Hahner, Rodrigo Iza-Teran, Jochen Garcke
Categories: cs.CV cs.LG stat.ML
\\
  For sequences of complex 3D shapes in time we present a general approach to
detect patterns for their analysis and to predict the deformation by making use
of structural components of the complex shape. We incorporate long short-term
memory (LSTM) layers into an autoencoder to create low dimensional
representations that allow the detection of patterns in the data and
additionally detect the temporal dynamics in the deformation behavior. This is
achieved with two decoders, one for reconstruction and one for prediction of
future time steps of the sequence. In a preprocessing step the components of
the studied object are converted to oriented bounding boxes which capture the
impact of plastic deformation and allow reducing the dimensionality of the data
describing the structure. The architecture is tested on the results of 196 car
crash simulations of a model with 133 different components, where material
properties are varied. In the latent representation we can detect patterns in
the plastic deformation for the different components. The predicted bounding
boxes give an estimate of the final simulation result and their quality is
improved in comparison to different baselines.

Title: Understanding Compositional Structures in Art Historical Images using
  Pose and Gaze Priors
Authors: Prathmesh Madhu, Tilman Marquart, Ronak Kosti, Peter Bell, Andreas
  Maier and Vincent Christlein
Categories: cs.CV eess.IV
Comments: To be Published in ECCV 2020 Workshops (VISART V)
\\
  Image compositions as a tool for analysis of artworks is of extreme
significance for art historians. These compositions are useful in analyzing the
interactions in an image to study artists and their artworks. Max Imdahl in his
work called Ikonik, along with other prominent art historians of the 20th
century, underlined the aesthetic and semantic importance of the structural
composition of an image. Understanding underlying compositional structures
within images is challenging and a time consuming task. Generating these
structures automatically using computer vision techniques (1) can help art
historians towards their sophisticated analysis by saving lot of time;
providing an overview and access to huge image repositories and (2) also
provide an important step towards an understanding of man made imagery by
machines. In this work, we attempt to automate this process using the existing
state of the art machine learning techniques, without involving any form of
training. Our approach, inspired by Max Imdahl's pioneering work, focuses on
two central themes of image composition: (a) detection of action regions and
action lines of the artwork; and (b) pose-based segmentation of foreground and
background. Currently, our approach works for artworks comprising of
protagonists (persons) in an image. In order to validate our approach
qualitatively and quantitatively, we conduct a user study involving experts and
non-experts. The outcome of the study highly correlates with our approach and
also demonstrates its domain-agnostic capability. We have open-sourced the code
at https://github.com/image-compostion-canvas-group/image-compostion-canvas.

Title: VisCode: Embedding Information in Visualization Images using
  Encoder-Decoder Network
Authors: Peiying Zhang, Chenhui Li, Changbo Wang
Categories: cs.CV cs.HC
Comments: 11 pages, 16 figures, conference
MSC-class: 68U99
\\
  We present an approach called VisCode for embedding information into
visualization images. This technology can implicitly embed data information
specified by the user into a visualization while ensuring that the encoded
visualization image is not distorted. The VisCode framework is based on a deep
neural network. We propose to use visualization images and QR codes data as
training data and design a robust deep encoder-decoder network. The designed
model considers the salient features of visualization images to reduce the
explicit visual loss caused by encoding. To further support large-scale
encoding and decoding, we consider the characteristics of information
visualization and propose a saliency-based QR code layout algorithm. We present
a variety of practical applications of VisCode in the context of information
visualization and conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the perceptual quality
of encoding, decoding success rate, anti-attack capability, time performance,
etc. The evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of VisCode.

  Deep Metric Learning (DML) approaches learn to represent inputs to a
lower-dimensional latent space such that the distance between representations
in this space corresponds with a predefined notion of similarity. This paper
investigates how the mapping element of DML may be exploited in situations
where the salient features in arbitrary classification problems vary over time
or due to changing underlying variables. Examples of such variable features
include seasonal and time-of-day variations in outdoor scenes in place
recognition tasks for autonomous navigation and age/gender variations in
human/animal subjects in classification tasks for medical/ethological studies.
Through the use of visualisation tools for observing the distribution of DML
representations per each query variable for which prior information is
available, the influence of each variable on the classification task may be
better understood. Based on these relationships, prior information on these
salient background variables may be exploited at the inference stage of the DML
approach by using a clustering algorithm to improve classification performance.
This research proposes such a methodology establishing the saliency of query
background variables and formulating clustering algorithms for better
separating latent-space representations at run-time. The paper also discusses
online management strategies to preserve the quality and diversity of data and
the representation of each class in the gallery of embeddings in the DML
approach. We also discuss latent works towards understanding the relevance of
underlying/multiple variables with DML.

Title: Intraoperative Liver Surface Completion with Graph Convolutional VAE

Categories: cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  In this work we propose a method based on geometric deep learning to predict
the complete surface of the liver, given a partial point cloud of the organ
obtained during the surgical laparoscopic procedure. We introduce a new data
augmentation technique that randomly perturbs shapes in their frequency domain
to compensate the limited size of our dataset. The core of our method is a
variational autoencoder (VAE) that is trained to learn a latent space for
complete shapes of the liver. At inference time, the generative part of the
model is embedded in an optimisation procedure where the latent representation
is iteratively updated to generate a model that matches the intraoperative
partial point cloud. The effect of this optimisation is a progressive non-rigid
deformation of the initially generated shape. Our method is qualitatively
evaluated on real data and quantitatively evaluated on synthetic data. We
compared with a state-of-the-art rigid registration algorithm, that our method
outperformed in visible areas.

  We consider a cops and robber game where the cops are blocking edges of a
graph, while the robber occupies its vertices. At each round of the game, the
cops choose some set of edges to block and right after the robber is obliged to
move to another vertex traversing at most $s$ unblocked edges ($s$ can be seen
as the speed of the robber). Both parts have complete knowledge of the
opponent's moves and the cops win when they occupy all edges incident to the
robbers position. We introduce the capture cost on $G$ against a robber of
speed $s$. This defines a hierarchy of invariants, namely $\delta^{1}_{\rm
e},\delta^{2}_{\rm e},\ldots,\delta^{\infty}_{\rm e}$, where
$\delta^{\infty}_{\rm e}$ is an edge-analogue of the admissibility graph
invariant, namely the {\em edge-admissibility} of a graph. We prove that the
problem asking wether $\delta^{s}_{\rm e}(G)\leq k$, is polynomially solvable
when $s\in \{1,2,\infty\}$ while, otherwise, it is NP-complete. Our main result
is a structural theorem for graphs of bounded edge-admissibility. We prove that
every graph of edge-admissibility at most $k$ can be constructed using $(\leq
k)$-edge-sums, starting from graphs whose all vertices, except possibly from
one, have degree at most $k$. Our structural result is approximately tight in
the sense that graphs generated by this construction always have
edge-admissibility at most $2k-1$. Our proofs are based on a precise structural
characterization of the graphs that do not contain $\theta_{r}$ as an
immersion, where $\theta_{r}$ is the graph on two vertices and $r$ parallel
edges.

Title: Responsive Matrix Cells: A Focus+Context Approach for Exploring and
  Editing Multivariate Graphs
Authors: Tom Horak, Philip Berger, Heidrun Schumann, Raimund Dachselt,

Categories: cs.GR cs.HC
Comments: Tom Horak and Philip Berger are joint first authors
\\
  Matrix visualizations are a useful tool to provide a general overview of a
graph's structure. For multivariate graphs, a remaining challenge is to cope
with the attributes that are associated with nodes and edges. Addressing this
challenge, we propose responsive matrix cells as a focus+context approach for
embedding additional interactive views into a matrix. Responsive matrix cells
are local zoomable regions of interest that provide auxiliary data exploration
and editing facilities for multivariate graphs. They behave responsively by
adapting their visual contents to the cell location, the available display
space, and the user task. Responsive matrix cells enable users to reveal
details about the graph, compare node and edge attributes, and edit data values
directly in a matrix without resorting to external views or tools. We report
the general design considerations for responsive matrix cells covering the
visual and interactive means necessary to support a seamless data exploration
and editing. Responsive matrix cells have been implemented in a web-based
prototype based on which we demonstrate the utility of our approach. We
describe a walk-through for the use case of analyzing a graph of soccer players
and report on insights from a preliminary user feedback session.

Title: A Fast Parametric Ellipse Algorithm
Authors: Jerry R. Van Aken
Categories: cs.GR
Comments: 19 pages, 6 figures, C++ source code
\\
  This paper describes a 2-D graphics algorithm that uses shifts and adds to
precisely plot a series of points on an ellipse of any shape and orientation.
The algorithm can also plot an elliptic arc that starts and ends at arbitrary
angles. The ellipse algorithm described here is largely based on earlier papers
by Van Aken and Simar [1,2], which extend Marvin Minsky's well-known circle
algorithm [3,4,5] to ellipses, and show how to cancel out the sources of error
in Minsky's original algorithm. A new flatness test is presented for
automatically controlling the spacing between points plotted on an ellipse or
elliptic arc. Most of the calculations performed by the ellipse algorithm and
flatness test use fixed-point addition and shift operations, and thus are
well-suited to run on less-powerful processors. C++ source code listings are
included.

algorithm, flatness, elliptic arc, conjugate diameters, affine invariance

\\
  Cold bent glass is a promising and cost-efficient method for realizing doubly
curved glass fa\c{c}ades. They are produced by attaching planar glass sheets to
curved frames and require keeping the occurring stress within safe limits.
However, it is very challenging to navigate the design space of cold bent glass
panels due to the fragility of the material, which impedes the form-finding for
practically feasible and aesthetically pleasing cold bent glass fa\c{c}ades. We
propose an interactive, data-driven approach for designing cold bent glass
fa\c{c}ades that can be seamlessly integrated into a typical architectural
design pipeline. Our method allows non-expert users to interactively edit a
parametric surface while providing real-time feedback on the deformed shape and
maximum stress of cold bent glass panels. Designs are automatically refined to
minimize several fairness criteria while maximal stresses are kept within glass
limits. We achieve interactive frame rates by using a differentiable Mixture
Density Network trained from more than a million simulations. Given a curved
boundary, our regression model is capable of handling multistable
configurations and accurately predicting the equilibrium shape of the panel and
its corresponding maximal stress. We show predictions are highly accurate and
validate our results with a physical realization of a cold bent glass surface.

Title: GPU Parallel Computation of Morse-Smale Complexes
Authors: Varshini Subhash, Karran Pandey, Vijay Natarajan
Categories: cs.GR
\\
  The Morse-Smale complex is a well studied topological structure that
represents the gradient flow behavior of a scalar function. It supports
multi-scale topological analysis and visualization of large scientific data.
Its computation poses significant algorithmic challenges when considering large
scale data and increased feature complexity. Several parallel algorithms have
been proposed towards the fast computation of the 3D Morse-Smale complex. The
non-trivial structure of the saddle-saddle connections are not amenable to
parallel computation. This paper describes a fine grained parallel method for
computing the Morse-Smale complex that is implemented on a GPU. The
saddle-saddle reachability is first determined via a transformation into a
sequence of vector operations followed by the path traversal, which is achieved
via a sequence of matrix operations. Computational experiments show that the
method achieves up to 7x speedup over current shared memory implementations.

Title: Sensors, Safety Models and A System-Level Approach to Safe and Scalable
  Automated Vehicles
Authors: Jack Weast
Categories: cs.RO cs.AI cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  When considering the accuracy of sensors in an automated vehicle (AV), it is
not sufficient to evaluate the performance of any given sensor in isolation.
Rather, the performance of any individual sensor must be considered in the
context of the overall system design. Techniques like redundancy and different
sensing modalities can reduce the chances of a sensing failure. Additionally,
the use of safety models is essential to understanding whether any particular
sensing failure is relevant. Only when the entire system design is taken into
account can one properly understand the meaning of safety-relevant sensing
failures in an AV. In this paper, we will consider what should actually
constitute a sensing failure, how safety models play an important role in
mitigating potential failures, how a system-level approach to safety will
deliver a safe and scalable AV, and what an acceptable sensing failure rate
should be considering the full picture of an AV's architecture.

Categories: eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG
\\
  Brain morphometry from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a consolidated
biomarker for many neurodegenerative diseases. Recent advances in this domain
indicate that deep convolutional neural networks can infer morphometric
measurements within a few seconds. Nevertheless, the accuracy of the devised
model for insightful bio-markers (mean curvature and thickness) remains
unsatisfactory. In this paper, we propose a more accurate and efficient neural
network model for brain morphometry named HerstonNet. More specifically, we
develop a 3D ResNet-based neural network to learn rich features directly from
MRI, design a multi-scale regression scheme by predicting morphometric measures
at feature maps of different resolutions, and leverage a robust optimization
method to avoid poor quality minima and reduce the prediction variance. As a
result, HerstonNet improves the existing approach by 24.30% in terms of
intraclass correlation coefficient (agreement measure) to FreeSurfer
silver-standards while maintaining a competitive run-time.

  Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved remarkable success in
medical image analysis tasks. In ultrasound (US) imaging, CNNs have been
applied to object classification, image reconstruction and tissue
characterization. However, CNNs can be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, even
small perturbations applied to input data may significantly affect model
performance and result in wrong output. In this work, we devise a novel
adversarial attack, specific to ultrasound (US) imaging. US images are
reconstructed based on radio-frequency signals. Since the appearance of US
images depends on the applied image reconstruction method, we explore the
possibility of fooling deep learning model by perturbing US B-mode image
reconstruction method. We apply zeroth order optimization to find small
perturbations of image reconstruction parameters, related to attenuation
compensation and amplitude compression, which can result in wrong output. We
illustrate our approach using a deep learning model developed for fatty liver
disease diagnosis, where the proposed adversarial attack achieved success rate
of 48%.

Title: Horus: Using Sensor Fusion to Combine Infrastructure and On-board
  Sensing to Improve Autonomous Vehicle Safety
Authors: Sanjay Seshan
Categories: cs.RO cs.CV cs.NI
Comments: Presented at Intel ISEF 2019
ACM-class: I.2.9; I.2.10
\\
  Studies predict that demand for autonomous vehicles will increase tenfold
between 2019 and 2026. However, recent high-profile accidents have
significantly impacted consumer confidence in this technology. The cause for
many of these accidents can be traced back to the inability of these vehicles
to correctly sense the impending danger. In response, manufacturers have been
improving the already extensive on-vehicle sensor packages to ensure that the
system always has access to the data necessary to ensure safe navigation.
However, these sensor packages only provide a view from the vehicle's
perspective and, as a result, autonomous vehicles still require frequent human
intervention to ensure safety.
  To address this issue, I developed a system, called Horus, that combines
on-vehicle and infrastructure-based sensors to provide a more complete view of
the environment, including areas not visible from the vehicle. I built a
small-scale experimental testbed as a proof of concept. My measurements of the
impact of sensor failures showed that even short outages (1 second) at slow
speeds (25 km/hr scaled velocity) prevents vehicles that rely on on-vehicle
sensors from navigating properly. My experiments also showed that Horus
dramatically improves driving safety and that the sensor fusion algorithm
selected plays a significant role in the quality of the navigation. With just a
pair of infrastructure sensors, Horus could tolerate sensors that fail 40% of
the time and still navigate safely. These results are a promising first step
towards safer autonomous vehicles.

Title: Imbalanced Continual Learning with Partitioning Reservoir Sampling
Authors: Chris Dongjoo Kim, Jinseo Jeong, and Gunhee Kim
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV stat.ML
Comments: Published to ECCV2020
\\
  Continual learning from a sequential stream of data is a crucial challenge
for machine learning research. Most studies have been conducted on this topic
under the single-label classification setting along with an assumption of
balanced label distribution. This work expands this research horizon towards
multi-label classification. In doing so, we identify unanticipated adversity
innately existent in many multi-label datasets, the long-tailed distribution.
We jointly address the two independently solved problems, Catastropic
Forgetting and the long-tailed label distribution by first empirically showing
a new challenge of destructive forgetting of the minority concepts on the tail.
Then, we curate two benchmark datasets, COCOseq and NUS-WIDEseq, that allow the
study of both intra- and inter-task imbalances. Lastly, we propose a new
sampling strategy for replay-based approach named Partitioning Reservoir
Sampling (PRS), which allows the model to maintain a balanced knowledge of both
head and tail classes. We publicly release the dataset and the code in our
project page.

Title: Learning more expressive joint distributions in multimodal variational
  methods
Authors: Sasho Nedelkoski, Mihail Bogojeski, Odej Kao
Categories: cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV stat.ML
Comments: 12 pages, Accepted and presented at LOD 2020
\\
  Data often are formed of multiple modalities, which jointly describe the
observed phenomena. Modeling the joint distribution of multimodal data requires
larger expressive power to capture high-level concepts and provide better data
representations. However, multimodal generative models based on variational
inference are limited due to the lack of flexibility of the approximate
posterior, which is obtained by searching within a known parametric family of
distributions. We introduce a method that improves the representational
capacity of multimodal variational methods using normalizing flows. It
approximates the joint posterior with a simple parametric distribution and
subsequently transforms into a more complex one. Through several experiments,
we demonstrate that the model improves on state-of-the-art multimodal methods
based on variational inference on various computer vision tasks such as
colorization, edge and mask detection, and weakly supervised learning. We also
show that learning more powerful approximate joint distributions improves the
quality of the generated samples. The code of our model is publicly available
at https://github.com/SashoNedelkoski/BPFDMVM.

\\
  Few-shot classification is a challenge in machine learning where the goal is
to train a classifier using a very limited number of labeled examples. This
scenario is likely to occur frequently in real life, for example when data
acquisition or labeling is expensive. In this work, we consider the problem of
post-labeled few-shot unsupervised learning, a classification task where
representations are learned in an unsupervised fashion, to be later labeled
using very few annotated examples. We argue that this problem is very likely to
occur on the edge, when the embedded device directly acquires the data, and the
expert needed to perform labeling cannot be prompted often. To address this
problem, we consider an algorithm consisting of the concatenation of transfer
learning with clustering using Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs). We introduce a
TensorFlow-based implementation to speed-up the process in multi-core CPUs and
GPUs. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the method using standard
off-the-shelf few-shot classification benchmarks.

Comments: In proceedings of European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV)
  Workshops. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2005.00953
\\
  Recent deep learning based single image super-resolution (SISR) methods
mostly train their models in a clean data domain where the low-resolution (LR)
and the high-resolution (HR) images come from noise-free settings (same domain)
due to the bicubic down-sampling assumption. However, such degradation process
is not available in real-world settings. We consider a deep cyclic network
structure to maintain the domain consistency between the LR and HR data
distributions, which is inspired by the recent success of CycleGAN in the
image-to-image translation applications. We propose the Super-Resolution
Residual Cyclic Generative Adversarial Network (SRResCycGAN) by training with a
generative adversarial network (GAN) framework for the LR to HR domain
translation in an end-to-end manner. We demonstrate our proposed approach in
the quantitative and qualitative experiments that generalize well to the real
image super-resolution and it is easy to deploy for the mobile/embedded
devices. In addition, our SR results on the AIM 2020 Real Image SR Challenge
datasets demonstrate that the proposed SR approach achieves comparable results
as the other state-of-art methods.

Title: Self-Supervised Scale Recovery for Monocular Depth and Egomotion
  Estimation
Authors: Brandon Wagstaff, Jonathan Kelly
Categories: cs.RO cs.CV
Comments: Manuscript submitted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)
  and ICRA 2021
\\
  The self-supervised loss formulation for jointly training depth and egomotion
neural networks with monocular images is well studied and has demonstrated
state-of-the-art accuracy. One of the main limitations of this approach,
however, is that the depth and egomotion estimates are only determined up to an
unknown scale. In this paper, we present a novel \textit{scale recovery loss}
that enforces consistency between a known camera height and the estimated
camera height, generating metric (scaled) depth and egomotion predictions. % We
show that our proposed method is competitive with other scale recovery
techniques (i.e., pose supervision and stereo left/right consistency
constraints). Further, we demonstrate how our method facilitates network
retraining within new environments, whereas other scale-resolving approaches
are incapable of doing so. Notably, our egomotion network is able to produce
more accurate estimates than a similar method that only recovers scale at test
time.

  Deep learning at its core, contains functions that are composition of a
linear transformation with a non-linear function known as activation function.
In past few years, there is an increasing interest in construction of novel
activation functions resulting in better learning. In this work, we propose a
family of novel activation functions, namely TanhSoft, with four undetermined
hyper-parameters of the form
tanh({\alpha}x+{\beta}e^{{\gamma}x})ln({\delta}+e^x) and tune these
hyper-parameters to obtain activation functions which are shown to outperform
several well known activation functions. For instance, replacing ReLU with
xtanh(0.6e^x)improves top-1 classification accuracy on CIFAR-10 by 0.46% for
DenseNet-169 and 0.7% for Inception-v3 while with tanh(0.87x)ln(1 +e^x) top-1
classification accuracy on CIFAR-100 improves by 1.24% for DenseNet-169 and
2.57% for SimpleNet model.

adenocarcinomas of lung as well as adenocarcinomas of colon using convolutional

Hereby, rendering artificial intelligence as useful technology in the near

containing 5000 images for each class. A shallow neural network architecture
was used classify the histopathological slides into squamous cell carcinomas,
adenocarcinomas and benign for the lung. Similar model was used to classify
adenocarcinomas and benign for colon. The diagnostic accuracy of more than 97%
and 96% was recorded for lung and colon respectively.

Title: Connectivity matters: Construction and exact random sampling of
  connected graphs
Authors: Szabolcs Horv\'at and Carl D. Modes
Categories: physics.soc-ph cs.DM math.CO
\\
  We describe a new method for the random sampling of connected graphs with a
specified degree sequence. We consider both the case of simple graphs and that
of loopless multigraphs. Our method builds on a recently introduced novel
sampling approach that constructs graphs independently (unlike edge-switching
Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods) and efficiently (unlike the configuration
model), and extends it to incorporate the constraint of connectivity.
Additionally, we present a simple and elegant algorithm for directly
constructing a single connected realization of a degree sequence, either as a
simple graph or a multigraph. Finally, we demonstrate our sampling method on a

Title: Tight List-Sizes for Oblivious AVCs under Constraints
Authors: Yihan Zhang, Sidharth Jaggi, Amitalok J. Budkuley
Categories: cs.IT cs.CC cs.DM math.CO math.IT
\\
  We study list-decoding over adversarial channels governed by oblivious
adversaries (a.k.a. oblivious Arbitrarily Varying Channels (AVCs)). This type
of adversaries aims to maliciously corrupt the communication without knowing
the actual transmission from the sender. For any oblivious AVCs potentially
with constraints on the sender's transmitted sequence and the adversary's noise
sequence, we determine the exact value of the minimum list-size that can
support a reliable communication at positive rate. This generalizes a classical
result by Hughes (IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, 1997) and answers an
open question posed by Sarwate and Gastpar (IEEE Transactions on Information
Theory, 2012). A lower bound on the list-decoding capacity (whenever positive)
is presented. Under a certain combinatorial conjecture, we also prove a
matching upper bound. En route to a tight characterization of the list-decoding
capacity, we propose a method for subcode construction towards the resolution
of the combinatorial conjecture.

Title: Improving Engagement of Animated Visualization with Visual Foreshadowing
Authors: Wenchao Li, Yun Wang, Haidong Zhang, Huamin Qu
Categories: cs.HC cs.GR
\\
  Animated visualization is becoming increasingly popular as a compelling way
to illustrate changes in time series data. However, maintaining the viewer's
focus throughout the entire animation is difficult because of its
time-consuming nature. Viewers are likely to become bored and distracted during
the ever-changing animated visualization. Informed by the role of foreshadowing
that builds the expectation in film and literature, we introduce visual
foreshadowing to improve the engagement of animated visualizations. In
specific, we propose designs of visual foreshadowing that engage the audience
while watching the animation. To demonstrate our approach, we built a
proof-of-concept animated visualization authoring tool that incorporates visual
foreshadowing techniques with various styles. Our user study indicates the
effectiveness of our foreshadowing techniques on improving engagement for
animated visualization.
